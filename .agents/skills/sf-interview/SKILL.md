# sf-interview

Use this at the start of every change, inside `/opsx:explore` or before `/opsx:propose`, and whenever the `brief` artifact is next. No spec is written until you can restate the user's wish and the user confirms it.

## Steps

1. **Ground first.** Use `sf-lookup` and `openspec list --specs` / `openspec show` to learn what exists. Never ask what you can verify yourself, and name any rejected decision that touches the idea. Keep the vision and the open commitments lookup shows in mind; a change must not quietly break a promise.
2. **Build the design tree:** outcome and scope first, then behavior, edge cases, constraints and non-functional needs. Each decision opens the ones that depend on it. Details: [references/design-tree.md](references/design-tree.md). If `knowledge/conventions/interview-checklist.md` exists, add the questions from its `## <Topic>` sections that touch this change as extra branches. They are what earlier retros said came too late.
3. **Ask in rounds** through the tool's native question UI (in Claude Code: `AskUserQuestion`, up to 4 questions per call, 2-4 options each, header at most 12 characters):
   - one decision per question;
   - the recommended option first, marked "(Recommended)", with a one-line reason;
   - the user can always answer in their own words.

   Without such a UI, ask in plain text: one decision per line, each with your recommendation.
4. **Never treat a missing answer as consent.** If an answer comes back empty or timed out, stop and ask again later. Don't decide on your own.
5. **Record, don't infer.** Keep every answer. "Whatever you think" becomes a delegated decision with your choice spelled out.
6. **Offer what is out of scope.** For everything the user put out of scope, ask one question each: keep it as a backlog item, record it as a deferred commitment ("not now, but we must before X"), or drop it. Write nothing yet.
7. **Close with a plan for approval.** When no open branch would change a requirement, present:
   - the wish in the user's words;
   - every decision with its source;
   - what is out of scope, and which of it becomes a backlog item or commitment;
   - the proposed change boundaries.

   In Claude Code use plan approval (`ExitPlanMode`); elsewhere show it as text and wait for an explicit "approve". Corrections start another round.
8. **Write `brief.md` only after approval,** from the schema template (`openspec instructions brief --change <name>`). Fill `Confirmation` with `human:<login>` and the approval time in ISO 8601 with offset, and only because they approved. Ask the user to state their login as part of approving; never take it from earlier briefs or the git config.

Then run `node scripts/specfold.mjs change check <change>`. Only the brief rules matter at this point.

After approval, also write what step 6 decided: `node scripts/specfold.mjs backlog add "<title>" --origin interview` for each backlog item, and `node scripts/specfold.mjs new "Deferred Commitment" commitments/<name>.md` for each commitment, with its `trigger`. Leave `committed_by` out; the person who commits adds it, and the gate checks it.

## Rules

- Questions are never a numbered list for the user to answer in prose when a native question UI exists.
- An open question may stay in the brief only with an owner and a reason it does not block the spec: `- <question> (owner: <actor>) <why>`.
- During implementation the same rule holds: on ambiguity, stop the task, ask, and record the answer in `brief.md` (and in the delta spec if behavior changes).
- Changes with `skip_specs: true` may use a short brief: Wish and Confirmation.
